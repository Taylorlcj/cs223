/*This program is supposed to read a file, write
over another file using distance calculations, and print the desired output */

/* I am aware that this code is disgusting, I am having a difficult time wrapping this
around my head and am getting a tutor to help me explain it and I did what I could to
get it as close to the desired output as possible with all of the variables and everything but
I just could not figure it out. This is the best I could do*/
